## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## About Project

During my online internship at CodSoft, I took on a solo project to create a Student Management System (SMS). With a focus on simplicity, I built features to add, remove, update, and view student details. Using Java, I crafted an easy-to-use interface for smooth navigation. I also set up a database backend using MySQL and JDBC for efficient data handling. Working remotely, I learned to manage my time well and communicate effectively with mentors. This experience not only boosted my tech skills but also taught me independence and resilience.

Special thanks to CodSoft, my colleagues, ChatGTP, BlockBox, and invaluable open resources like StackOverflow and YouTube tutorials for enhancing the efficiency of my code.
